## Features:
- ### Integration with dialogue system:
  - Character is highlighted while speaking.
  - Option is highlighted as the user mouses over.
  - Example flow is created using the editor.
  - Ability to define "characters" (An enum in a file that a character will use to associate itself with a dialogue).
- ### Editor (I learned a lot through tutorials)
  - Ability to create, save and load new dialogue trees.
  - Ability to edit the text and answers.
  - Node based editor to connect all the dialogue boxes together
